/*
 * V34 wide-uncached-access switch.
 *
 * The bounce buffer is MmNonCached, which on this platform is Device memory:
 * every access is its own bus transaction, nothing merges, nothing caches. The
 * transfer helpers move it a ULONG at a time, so a 64 KB read costs 16384
 * uncached loads to drain the bounce plus 16384 uncached stores to pre-zero it,
 * all on one 1.05 GHz core.
 *
 * This switch widens the aligned fast path from 32-bit to 64-bit accesses,
 * halving the transaction count. It is the same class of change this file
 * already documents making once before - byte-at-a-time to ULONG-at-a-time,
 * which it records as having "dominated boot" until fixed.
 *
 * A 64-bit access to Device memory is a single, naturally-atomic transaction
 * when the address is 8-byte aligned, so this preserves both the bytes written
 * and the order they are written in. Alignment is checked, never assumed: the
 * bounce is page aligned, but Storport only guarantees Srb->DataBuffer meets
 * the adapter's ULONG mask, and an unaligned access to uncached memory raises
 * the synchronous alignment abort that cost this project the V16/V20-V23
 * builds.
 *
 * Kept OFF by default. It is an optimisation, and the driver that owns the
 * Windows volume does not take optimisations on prediction - it takes them on
 * the measurement UFS_PERF_INSTRUMENTATION produces.

 * V35 FMP DMA-window enforcement.
 *
 * Unlike the two switches above this is a CORRECTNESS fix, not measurement and
 * not an optimisation, and it is required before DRAM bank1 can be published as
 * conventional memory.
 *
 * The first MR1 boot hung on the Windows logo with no spinner. The firmware
 * side had worked perfectly - PRAM recorded "=MR1 published=000000001ef3c000
 * verdict=FULL", i.e. all 495.2 MiB added - but the driver declares only
 * Dma32BitAddresses=TRUE and takes its DMA workspace from
 * StorPortGetUncachedExtension. "Below 4 GB" was an accurate description of the
 * machine only while the sole conventional memory below 4 GB happened to be the
 * FMP-reachable window. Publishing bank1 made that false, Storport was free to
 * place the UTRL/UCD/bounce where the controller's DMA cannot reach, and
 * storage never initialised.
 *
 * It is a separate switch so it can be proven on its own boot WITHOUT bank1
 * (where it must be a no-op, because every allocation is already in-window),
 * before it is relied on to make MR1 safe.

 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. UfsDiag.exe reports through stdout, which the loader
 * redirects to X: - the WinPE RAM disk. The unattended cycle ends in a hard PMU
 * reset, so every one of those logs is destroyed before the host can read it.
 * A helper step that FAILS is therefore completely unobservable, which is
 * exactly the step whose failure reason matters.
 *
 * PRAM survives the reset and is pulled from TWRP, but by the time the helper
 * runs the ring is already full (UFS_PRAM_CAPACITY 0x3F00, ~16 KiB, and the
 * driver's own records fill it), so an appended record is silently dropped.
 * The driver therefore RESERVES a small block of note slots at ring offset 0
 * during UfsPramInitialize and rewrites them in place - see UfsPramNote.
 *
 * Guarded exactly like the reboot and arm CDBs: opcode + subcode + a distinct
 * confirmation word. It touches no register and no media; it only stores bytes
 * into the already-mapped PRAM window. A 16-byte CDB is required because the
